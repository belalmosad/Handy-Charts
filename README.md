# Handy-Charts
JavaScript library that helps you to create charts for data visualisation.

## Problems and Solution
- ### **Problem 1**: Could not imagine how the library works, how to structure files, and how should it be included and used in other projects.
    - **Solution**: I read many articles about how to create JS library and how to organize files.


## Technologies Used
- Vanilla JavaScript.
- Sass.
- CSS.

## TODOs
- [x] Add `ProgressBar` js class with drawing bar functionality.
- [x] Implement themes in scss.
